Homework 4 for Machine Learning (CS465): Spam Classification using SVMs
- Trained a SVM to classify emails into spam / no spam (aka ham). 
- Used a subset of the pre-processed Enrom-Spam data set. 
- Used 8,000 training examples labeled ham/spam, and 2,000 test examples with hidden labels. 
- Utilized the fast, light-weight SVM implementation SVMlight by Thorsten Joachims.

Wrote python code that:
1)  Extracts a useful word list from all email message
2)  Translates each training example into a feature vector and saves it in a format suitable for SVMlight
3)  Tuned the SVM algorithm for best performance.
